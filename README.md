# JBCrates

The plugin that will revolutionize crates. *totally*. Anyways, this plugin will be the crates plugin used on the PrismForge Jailbreak server. 

Built on Paper 1.19.4. So all releases support Paper 1.19.4.
## Commands


### /getCrateRewards
Perm: jbcrates.getcraterewards

`/getCrateRewards` Gives the player any rewards they may not have gotten.

### /jbcrates 
Perm: jbcrates.admin

`/jbcrates` Brings up the menu for managing crates.

`/jbcrates give <player> <crate_id>` Gives the input player a crate based on the id.

## To-Do
I will track my progress here and try to think of every possible task.
